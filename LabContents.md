## 1 Intro to Raspberry Pi
Show how to get started with setting up your Raspberry Pi and learn more about the environment you will be working in throughout the course of these modules.

## 2 Intro to Linux
Introduce you to the Linux Operating System and give you an overview of where things are located and what applications are included with Kali Linux regarding cybersecurity and networking.

## 3 DIY Wi-Fi Pineapple
Construct a DIY Wi-Fi pineapple for wireless security/hacking using a GL.iNet GL-AR150. Teach people how a wireless attack works and how to use tools to perform a wireless attack as well as how to spoof an IP address.

## 4 Password Cracking
Show students how easy it is to break an MD5 Hash using Rockyou. Alongside this, we want to scare students into changing their password HaveIBeenPwned and how to create a good password with https://howsecureismypassword.net/

## 5 Shodan
Introduce students to Shodan and port scanning to show them the importance of changing default credentials and how dangerous the open internet is by showing them open control stations/webcams etc.

## 6 DIY Rubber Ducky
Show students how to create their own rubber ducky using a Digispark ATTINY85 and programming it with arduino commands. Then we can show them the variety of payloads such as opening a website, changing a wallpaper, or running a program, all hands free. 

## 7 Steganography
Hide information inside of images using utilities like s-tools or steghide. Students will encrypt a notepad document full of secrets onto any given image. The image can be stored indiscriminately on the desktop or sent over email, then can be unencrypted to show the hidden message.

## 8 Metasploit
Give students a use case (Certain computer/Item) that they should find an exploit for and showcase the sheer amount of exploits and knowledge within Metasploit

## 9 Nmap
Teach students how to use Nmap to perform network scans. Nmap is a free and open source tool used for network discovery as well as security auditing. Using Nmap, students will be able to scan for IP packets and use them to determine network characteristics.

## 10 SQL Injection
Using a public testing website, walk students through manual and automated SQL injection attacks. Describe how SQL works and show how easily it is to break, then show how it can be automated with sqlninja.- https://demo.testfire.net/login.jsp
