# About
The High Availability Cybersecurity Kit is a low cost cybersecurity training kit for middle school and high school students. H.A.C.K. will introduce the concepts of networking, Linux, Raspberry Pi, password cracking, wireless attacks and much more. Modules with tutorials will lead students through the activities with a focus on experimentation and exploration, hopefully lighting a spark of curiosity that could lead into a career in cybersecurity.
